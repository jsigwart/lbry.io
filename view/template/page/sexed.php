      <h3>YouTube is purging sex ed and sexuality-related content.</h3>
      <p>Over the past few months, sex ed, LGBTQ, and other sexuality-related channels <a href="https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/9k89wv/sex-ed-vloggers-say-youtube-is-censoring-their-videos">have been disappearing from YouTube</a>. YouTube's vague content rules mean that they get to pick and choose who’s allowed to talk about sex.</p>
      <p>It’s no surprise that the channels that are disappearing aren’t typically household names - a sex ed guru with a small audience won’t get the benefit of the doubt that Dr. Laura or other well-known figures will. </p>
      <p>As long as YouTube depends on revenue from advertisers, you can expect to see more and more of these periodic spasms of censorship.</p>
      <h3>We can do better.</h3>
      <p>At LBRY, we don’t want to pick winners and losers. We don’t rely on advertisers for revenue. Instead, we make it possible for creators to be compensated directly by their fans.</p>

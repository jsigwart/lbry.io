When the LBRY daemon is running, it provides a set of API calls available via a webserver running on localhost.

We want to make it as easy as possible to interact with LBRY in every programming language.

Completing this bounty involves creating a simple library to make it as easy as possible to interact with the LBRY protocol in a language we do not already have a binding for.

An example of a binding can be found in the [php-api](https://github.com/lbryio/php-api) repo.

A binding can typically be written using cURL in less than 100 lines of code.

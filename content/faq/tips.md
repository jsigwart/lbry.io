If you've been linked or directed to this page, it's most likely because we've noticed you made a contribution to LBRY. So first of all, ***THANK YOU*** from the LBRY team and all other LBRYians (of which you should now count yourself!). 

Public contributions are crucial for the development and continued success of the LBRY application and network. Whether it's a good suggestion, a code submission, a thorough bug report or just raising awareness of LBRY, each strengthens the community and network.

Providing you with a tip, in LBRY Credits (LBC), is our recognition and appreciation for your time and effort. This bonus is completely optional and can be redeemed at your discretion. 

## How do I redeem my tip?

You already completed the hard part, so we'll try to make this as easy as possible.

Simply send us an [email](mailto:hello@lbry.io) with the relevant details for your contribution. For example, if linked to this page from a pull request, send the link to the pull request. Or if someone shared this link on social media, send us the thread, etc.  Also, include your LBC address.

If you don't have an address, download [LBRY](https://lbry.io/get) to create one. 

## I haven't contributed yet. How can I help?

We've compiled a [contributing guide](https://lbry.io/faq/contributing) which is a good place to start if you are interested in making LBRY great!

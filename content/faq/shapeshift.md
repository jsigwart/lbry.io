The ability to convert your cryptoassets into LBRY Credits (LBC) is available directly within the LBRY app, powered by [ShapeShift](https://info.shapeshift.io/about). LBRY Inc. does not handle any of the incoming funds, and the LBC are sent from ShapeShift directly. 

*Note: ShapeShift is unavailable in New York and Washington (and possibly surrounding areas based on IP geolocation). You will see an `HTTP status code: 403` error if this happens. Please see [ShapeShift](https://shapeshift.io) for more information.* 	 

## Convert Crypto to LBC
1. Open the LBRY app, access the Wallet (bank icon next to the Publish button) and click on **Get Credits**

2. In the **Convert Crypto to LBC** section, choose from BTC, BCH, DASH, ETH, LTC or XMR to convert into LBC

3. Review the given rate of exchange and min/max amount. ShapeShift charges a small [fee](https://info.shapeshift.io/about) for the transaction
4. Enter the return address for the cryptoasset in case something were to go wrong with the process (if the address is not provided, you'll need to contact ShapeShift about your refund).

**Moving your channel onto LBRY**

LBRY offers an easy way for YouTubers to sync their content to the LBRY network, engage with LBRY users, and earn LBC.

To sync your existing channel to LBRY and learn more about the program, use the [LBRY.io YouTube Sync page](https://lbry.io/youtube).

Authenticating your YouTube channel and other information puts your content into a queue to be automatically mirrored on the LBRY network. This serves as an alternative to moving your entire channel by yourself. The content, its title and description, as well as thumbnails and other metadata, will sync to your channel name. When it is done, you will receive a notice from LBRY indicating your channel is available to view.


When you sync your channel, you are also eligible to receive LBRY Credits in our Partner Program based on your subscriber count. Receiving these credits is subject to a one-year agreement. The exact agreement you make when you sync can be seen [here](https://lbry.io/faq/youtube-terms). The current rewards for syncing can be seen on the [sync page](https://lbry.io/youtube).

**How to Receive Your LBRY Credits**

- Download the LBRY App at https://lbry.io/get
- Run the LBRY App (this can take a while on your first start up)
- Make sure the email saved in the application matches the email address on your [Sync Status Page](https://lbry.io/youtube/status)
- Click the Bank icon in the upper righthand corner
- Navigate to the Rewards section of your wallet
- Scroll to the "YouTube Reward" claim button
- If you met a particular subscriber threshold, you should receive the appropriate amount of credits.


If you're having any trouble with the sync process or receiving your credits, please contact [help@lbry.io](mailto:help@lbry.io).
